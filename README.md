# BindsManagerUltimate
Recode of the Binds-Manager by Kognity. New code, Logs, new UI, less efficiency, no adverts and many more.

## Installation
Grab the **.exe** file from [here](http://github.com/TheUltiOne/BindsManagerUltimate/releases/latest "here") and run it. It does not need admin permissions. Make sure to **not** download the **Source code** files. Just grab the exe and you will be done.

It is a standalone exe, so it doesn't need any setup or anything.

## Usage

It should look something like this. There is a label that will inform you of your command binds. As of right now, the window isn't sizable or movable but I'm working on it.

Choose a key in the dropdown menu in the bottom right, then write your command in the box below. Press add command and it will save it for you! You can select admin command if it is an admin command.

Press save to get a .ult file of your command binds. You can share this file to other people to share your presets, or make challenges!

Press open to take a .ult file's contents onto your bind manager. You will be given the option to save it as yours or to just view it.
**Warning:** If you add a command  while "just viewing", it will save your binds as this. I will add a new feature to prevent this soon.

Press reset your binds to reset the bind manager and your binds along the way.

Press Open Saved to view your saved .ult preset files.

## Credits
Originally made by Kognity, and I used a little bit of his code. Otherwise, it's not a clone or a fork, entirely new project with my code (from my fork) and some new stuff! Enjoy!
